# emailimg-rpi
A simple tool turns a Raspberry Pi (RPi) into a security monitoring system, using email as a transport layer. The script has only been tested with an outlook.com account.

# What are needed
- A Raspberry Pi (version 1-3) Model B (needs Internet connectivity)
- A camera module (this would work: https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/)
- Imagemagick (for image conversion on the RPi)
- Python 2.7: smtplib, pyOpenSSL, ndg-httpsclient, pyasn1, PIL
- An email account (a free one can be obtained from live.com)

## Tweet a time-lapse GIF every 20 minutes

Usage:


2. Create a Twitter app and obtain the API Key, API Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret for the app. This can be done by following the instructions at: http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Twitterbot/?ALLSTEPS.

3. Override the corresponding strings in the file '.auth' with appropriate Twitter app API access token strings obtained in the last step.

4. Because we are going to write and delete a lot of files, in order to prevent the SD card worn out, create a ramdisk (of size 25M bytes) to store image files created during the process.
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/ramdisk
    mount -t tmpfs -o size=25m tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
    ```
   To make the ramdisk persist over reboots, add the following lines to `/etc/fstab`:

    ```
    # ramdisk for camera capture (added 20160306)
    tmpfs       /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noexec,nodiratime,size=25m   0 0
    ``` 
5. Create a cron job to take a still picture from the RPi camera module every 1 minute. Do `crontab -e` and add the following:

    ```
    # take still picture every 1 minute
    * * * * * /home/pi/bin/twitimg-rpi/camera_raspistill.sh 2>&1
    ```

  Create a cron job to upload an animated GIF image combined from the still images taken in the past 20 minutes. Do `crontab -e` and add the following:

    ```
    # upload image every 20 minutes
    0,20,40 * * * * /home/pi/bin/twitimg-rpi/twitimg-run.sh
    ```

  Because currently Twitter only allows uploading of an animated GIF of maximum size of 5M bytes, this setting works well for me. You may want to tweak the frequencies of taking still pictures and uploading according to your situation.

6. Connect the RPi to the Internet, and watch the stream of videos from your Twitter timeline.

## Tweet a JPEG image upon motion detection

Usage:

1. Install the camera module on the RPi, and enable camera module from `rspi-config` menu.

2. Obtain an email account that supports SMTP (e.g., from outlook.com). 

3. Override the corresponding strings in `.config` with the respective values, for the SMTP server name & port, email username (address), and email password.

4. Create a ramdisk of size 80M bytes to store motion-detected image files.
   ```
   mkdir /mnt/ramdisk_motion
   mount -t tmpfs -o size=80M tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk_motion 
   ```

   To make the ramdisk persist over reboots, add the following lines to `/etc/fstab`:
   ```
    # ramdisk for camera capture
    tmpfs       /mnt/ramdisk_motion tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,noexec,nodiratime,size=80m   0 0
   ``` 

5. Run `emailimg-motion-run.sh`. 

6. (Optional) To turn off the LED red light in the camera module when taking pictures, edit the file `/boot/config.txt` to add / change the following line:
    ```
    disable_camera_led=1
    ```
